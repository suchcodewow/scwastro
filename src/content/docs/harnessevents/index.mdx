### Step Blocks

UI-based instructions. Typically accompanied by a pretty snazzy picture with # indicating where to click.

| click:                | #   |
| --------------------- | --- |
| Click this thing      | 1   |
| And that other thing! | 2   |
| Move it               | 3   |

### Code Blocks

Handy blocks with pre-formatted text that, when hovered over, offer a copy button. When clicked, you can paste the result directly into Harness.
