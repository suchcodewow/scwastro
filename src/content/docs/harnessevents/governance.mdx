## Goals

With Harness, governance and security is paramount- and the platform is uniquely built to provide peace of mind for security teams while empowering software delivery.

In this section, we'll get a view of how a security team could implement critical security policies.. and then show how developers can elegantly, easily meet those policies.

## Lab Guide

:::tip[Wyatt, You're an OAK]
The steps below are just to show how it can be done- you won't have access directly since it's done outside the typical lab permissions. We just need 1 person to be the security team here. Sorry. I'm not sure how to pick. Maybe the first person to call out "I'm your Huckleberry" or ["GO ahead, skin that smokewagon and see what happens"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq34rCkcY0M) gets to be the security team? Is that even still a thing? I feel old.
