title: K3s

These steps build a kubernetes cluster using k3s.  
k3s is an extremely light-weight but capable kubernetes distribution.

:::info Prerequisites
Ensure you can login to your ubuntu host & that you have administrative ability.  
If you're following this section from previous tutorials you should be all set.
:::

## Install Kubernetes

Login to your host and install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#what-can-i-use-docker-for).

```bash
curl https://releases.rancher.com/install-docker/19.03.sh | sh
```

Install the base kubernetes k3s package.

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="--no-deploy traefik" sh -s -  --docker
```

- **curl** downloads the k3s installer.
- **|** is the pipe command chaining multiple commands together.
- **INSTALL_K3S_EXEC...** sets an environment variable instructing the install to skip k3s' default ingress controller traefik.
- **sh -** runs the result of the previous step in a shell (in this case, the k3s install).

## Copy config file to default location & install kubectl

Create a folder and move the kubernetes config file to a default location to help further standardize this kubernetes install.

<details>
  <summary>What is the kubernetes config file?</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Kubernetes distributions create a config file that describe the cluster and how to access it.</li>
    <li>These next few steps move the k3s config file to the default spot where kubectl will look & secure the file to avoid errors later.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

```bash
mkdir -m700 ~/.kube
```

- **mkdir** is the linux **make directory** command.
- **-m700** limits the permissions to just our user (preventing security warnings later)
- **~/.kube** is the standard folder location for the config file.

Export the config file to the folder you created.

```bash
sudo cp /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/.kube/config
```

Ensure you are the file's owner (prevents security warnings/issues later).

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER ~/.kube
```

## Install kubectl

k3s comes with a slightly modified kubectl command. There's nothing wrong with it-
but to make sure kubernetes works in a standard way across all tutorials, we'll install and use the official kubectl.

Download kubectl.

```bash
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
```

<details>
  <summary>What is kubectl?</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Kubernetes's interface is an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API). We need a way to interact with it.</li>
    <li>kubectl is a well organized/documented command line tool to achieve this. Running `kubectl` will show you the myriad of options available.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

:::info

The weird bonus curl command in the middle simply gets the most current version number for downloading in the main curl command. #InceptionButWithCurl

:::

Install.

```bash
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

## :checkered_flag: Checkpoint

To check that everything works, run the following.

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

If you see a response indicating a `READY` status, congratulations :tada:! You have kubernetes.

## Final config for k3s

We skipped the k3s ingress controller during install. We'll install nginx with the command below.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.1.2/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
```

<details>
  <summary>New Ingress, who dis?</summary>

By default, Kubernetes sets up a virtual network between the containers. This lets application components communicate with each other and (generally) the internet.

We need an [ingress controller](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/kubernetes-ingress-controller)
to manage cluster access from the outside. It's like adding a gate
to a walled city with guards directing traffic. It allows access to approved
locations and prevents unauthorized requests.
