This tutorial series was designed to give you a good kubernetes platform built from scratch while demonstrating key concepts.

The tutorial is modular. Work from step 1 through step 4 making 1 choice in each category depending on your needs.

_Current tutorial state showing planned additions in dark gray._

After completing step 4 you can check out the deployments available and add any that meet your needs.

:clock10: Deploying everything takes less than 30 minutes- but if you are learning kubernetes (the intention of this series), allow time to check out the links/tips provided and practice as you go.

:::tip Accelerators
Check out the [accelerators](/docs/accelerator-azure) page for pre-built "recipes" if you aren't sure which options to pick.

### Step 1: Setup a host

Using one of the options available, build a host to run kubernetes.

### Step 2: Deploy Kubernetes on your host

Different kubernetes distributions offer different advantages. The options range from small footprint running only critical functions to fully featured larger installations.

### Step 3: Deploy Dynatrace

Any of the kubernetes platforms shown can be monitored by Dynatrace to provide unrivaled observability and A.I. driven insights. If you don't have Dynatrace now, consider setting up your own free trial in just a few minutes at https://www.dynatrace.com/trial.

### Step 4+: First Application & more deployments

With the platform running, deploy a simple web service to confirm that everything works.

### Add Deployments

With your completed kubernetes platform, check out the projects you can deploy and share with team members.
