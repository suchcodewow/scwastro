# Setup a Host

Any of the options below work just fine. Ideally having access to a host that can run as a server 24/7 (either locally or a cloud provider) would give you the most flexibility.

## General Requirements

- CPU: 2-4vcpu
- Memory: 4GB+ (more would allow more scenarios to run at the same time)
- An IP address that doesn't change.

### Step 1: Setup a Host

You can choose from different methods to setup a host. The options range from using resources on a computer you already have, through setting up a host or using a virtual machine in any of the major cloud providers.
