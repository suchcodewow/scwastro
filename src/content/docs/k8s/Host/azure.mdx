title: Setup Azure vm

:::info Prerequisites
You'll need to have rights to create and modify virtual machines.
:::

## Login to Azure Portal

[Click here to login to Azure and open a cloud shell ](https://portal.azure.com/#cloudshell):link:.

If you get the welcome message, choose **PowerShell**. Create storage in a subscription where you have access.
![choose powershell](/img/choose_powershell.jpg)  
When your shell loads, check that you are running Powershell in the top left of your window. If not, use the drop down arrow to change it.
![azure ps](/img/powershell.png)

Switch into your cloud drive so anything you download and run will persist from session to session.

```bash
cd ~/clouddrive
```

## Download the helper script

This script lets you pick a subscription, creates a unique resource group for you (critical if others running this tutorial in the same subscription), and provides common commands.

Download the helper script:

```bash
curl https://www.suchcodewow.io/manifests/helper.ps1 > ~/clouddrive/helper.ps1
```

:::tip 'show commands' vs 'Y U spam me'
By default, the helper script shows each command as it runs- helpful if you are new to Azure. It can be turned off by and changing `$show_commands = $true` to `$show_commands = $false` near the top.
:::

## Create the virtual machine

:::warning Check your subscription!
Your shell is connected to a [subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/subscriptions-licenses-accounts-and-tenants-for-microsoft-cloud-offerings?view=o365-worldwide). When you create something in Azure it is added to that subscription.
Ensure you choose the subscription where you want to build your host.

:::

Run the helper script to create a resource group and a host.

```bash
~/clouddrive/helper.ps1
```

:::info What's happening here?
The script:

1. uses your email up to '@' as a unique identifier.
1. allows you to select a subscription (and set it as default).
1. [creates a resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/group?view=azure-cli-latest) in the format: scw-group-(name).
1. [creates a vm](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/vm?view=azure-cli-latest#az-vm-create) in that resource group with the format: scw-host-(name).
1. saves the public IP of your host into the _myip_ file.

About the host creation step:

- We're using the long term support (LTS) version of Ubuntu linux for the **image**.
- The **- - size Standard_B2ms** is a good combination of price and a large enough host (2cpu & 8gb mem) to run kubernetes.
- **public-ip-sku** assigns a public IP address so we can access our machine remotely.
- We're generating an ssh key (or using your existing one) instead of a password to login.

:::

Once the script menu appears, press < enter > and quit. You can run the helper script again at any time.

Copy the **myip** file into your host.

> choose `yes` if asked to store your host's fingerprint.

:::tip
The default user is **azureuser**. No need to change it below! You didn't miss anything.
:::

```bash
scp myip azureuser@$(cat myip):/home/azureuser/myip
```

<details>
  <summary>Waiter, there seems to be a cat in my scp?</summary>SCP is the secure
  copy command. We're using it to copy the myip file to your host to use later.
  The cat command outputs the file contents (just the ip address in this case)
  and the $() part means "run whatever command is in here". In the end, scp gets
  the azure user name and the IP of the host. The part after ':' is the folder
  and filename on your host where scp saves the file.
</details>

## :checkered_flag: Checkpoint

Run the helper script:

```bash
~/clouddrive/helper.ps1
```

Once it loads, you'll see options to quickly login to your Azure VM or reset the password. It also shows you the exact command it runs to perform those steps if you want to copy them out to use later.

If you successfully login, congratulations! You've configured your host.
