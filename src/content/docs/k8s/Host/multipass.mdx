Multipass is an application that allows you to virtually host an ubuntu linux server on your computer.

## Download and Install **Multipass** using the defaults

[Download on MAC](https://multipass.run/download/macos) or [Download on PC](https://multipass.run/download/windows)

## Launch a new ubuntu server

When the installation is complete, open a terminal window and run:

```bash
multipass launch -c 4 -m 4G -d 64GB -n DTkube
```

:::info
This creates an ubuntu server that can use 4 cores, 4 GB of memory, and is named DTkube.  
The `-d 64GB` command allocates maximum hard disk size. Multipass will only use space consumed by the ubuntu server's files & you won't actually use up 64GB of space on your computer.
:::

## Get the IP address of your new server

```bash
multipass info DTkube
```

> Name: DTkube  
> State: Running  
> IPv4: **192.168.x.x** (this)

:::tip
You can run `multipass list` to show all servers if you have several.
:::

## Add this IP address to your hosts file

Open your hosts file and add _rancher.localdev_ with the IP. (Replace x's with actual IP from previous step)

Hosts file example:

> 192.168.1.1 server1  
> 192.168.1.2 server2  
> **192.168.x.x rancher.localdev**

## Log in to the server

Connect to your new ubuntu server.

```bash
multipass shell DTkube
```

> Multipass automatically creates an account named _ubuntu_ for you and logs in with this account automatically. You won't need a password when using _sudo_.  
> **sudo** is a way to preface commands in linux that elevates your permission to root (administrator) level temporarily.

## (Recommended) Update your server

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Managing Multipass

### Start/Stop

In the nearly unthinkable situation of pausing this tutorial, you can simply shut down this lab's virtual machine with:

```bash
multipass stop DTkube
```

This will release all used resources on your computer aside from the nominal disk space used. Restart with:

```bash
multipass start Dtkube
```

### Remove Multipass server

To completely remove the Multipass server, shut down then delete the instance:

```bash
multipass stop DTkube
multipass delete DTkube
```

```bash
multipass purge
```

### Uninstall Multipass

If you are ready to

- In windows, use Add/Remove Programs.
- On Mac, you can use:

```bash
sudo chmod 755 "/Library/Application Support/com.canonical.multipass/uninstall.sh"
sudo "/Library/Application Support/com.canonical.multipass/uninstall.sh"
```
