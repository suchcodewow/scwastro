title: Install k0s
---

These steps build a kubernetes cluster using k0s.  
k0s is an extremely light-weight but capable kubernetes distribution.

:::info Prerequisites
Ensure you can login to your ubuntu host & that you have administrative ability.  
If you're following this section from previous tutorials you should be all set.
:::

## Install Kubernetes

Login to your host and download the base k0s package.

```bash
curl -sSLf https://get.k0s.sh | sudo sh
```

- **curl** downloads the k0s installer.
- **|** is the pipe command chaining multiple commands together.
- **sh -** runs the result of the previous step in a shell (in this case, the k3s install).

Install.

```bash
sudo k0s install controller --single
```

Start k0s.

```bash
sudo k0s start
```

## Copy config file to default folder & install kubectl

Create a folder and move the kubernetes config file to a default location to help further standardize this kubernetes install.

<details>
  <summary>What is the kubernetes config file?</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Kubernetes distributions create a config file that describe the cluster
      and how to access it.
    </li>
    <li>
      These next few steps move the k3s config file to the default spot where
      kubectl will look & secure the file to avoid errors later.
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

```bash
mkdir -m700 ~/.kube
```

- **mkdir** is the linux **make directory** command.
- **-m700** limits the permissions to just our user (preventing security warnings later)
- **~/.kube** is the standard folder location for the config file.

Export the config file to the folder you created.

```bash
sudo  k0s kubeconfig admin > ~/.kube/config
```

## Install kubectl

k0s comes with a slightly modified kubectl command. There's nothing wrong with it-
but to make sure kubernetes works in a standard way across all tutorials, we'll install and use the official kubectl.

Download kubectl.

```bash
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
```

<details>
  <summary>What is kubectl?</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Kubernetes's interface is an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API). We
      need a way to interact with it.
    </li>
    <li>
      kubectl is a well organized/documented command line tool to achieve this.
      Running `kubectl` will show you the myriad of options available.
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

:::info

The weird bonus curl command in the middle simply gets the most current version number for downloading in the main curl command. #InceptionButWithCurl

:::

Install.

```bash
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

## :checkered_flag: Checkpoint

To check that everything works, run the following.

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

If you see a response indicating a `READY` status, congratulations :tada:! You have kubernetes.

## Final config for k0s

k0s needs an ingress controller. Add nginx by applying its config yaml:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.2.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
```

<details>
  <summary>New Ingress, who dis?</summary>

By default, Kubernetes sets up a virtual network between the containers. This lets application components communicate with each other and (generally) the internet.

We need an [ingress controller](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/kubernetes-ingress-controller)
to manage cluster access from the outside. It's like adding a gate
to a walled city with guards directing traffic. It allows access to approved
locations and prevents unauthorized requests.
