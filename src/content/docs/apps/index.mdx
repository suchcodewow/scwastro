## About

Pepper quickly deploys kubernetes and real-world sample applications on your choice of cloud.  
Pepper shows every step along with the exact command it runs on your behalf.  
You'll get a useful kubernetes installation very quickly while seeing how to do it yourself.

You'll need the ability to use the cloud shell of your chosen cloud provider or be able to connect with a local terminal.

## Usage

Run:

```bash
curl https://www.suchcodewow.io/manifests/pepper.ps1 -s > ~/pepper.ps1 && pwsh ~/pepper.ps1 -c
```

Supported options:

- `-c` Show cloud commands. Command history logged to **pepper.ps1.log** file for reference.
- `-v` Show trivial/verbose commands. Chatty, but good feedback when modifying Pepper.
- `-h` Shows all options.
