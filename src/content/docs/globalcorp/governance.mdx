### Platform Concepts: Governance and security

- With Harness, governance is built into the platform from the ground up and centrally managed.
- Policies define what the guardrails should be and the Harness open policy agent enforces all of the rules, all of the time.
- When teams adhere to policies, governance is still tracked- but invisible.

#### A) Enable policy

1. On the left nav, click _Organization settings_.
1. Click _Policies_, then _Policy Sets_ in the top right corner.
1. **One person, acting as the security team**, enables the security policy.

#### B) Policy is enforced, Duh...duh.... DUUUUH!

1. In the left nav, click on the scope selector top left.
1. Select your project, and click _Pipelines_ if necessary in the left nav.
1. Click on the "Fastlane-Java" pipeline.
1. Click on _Java Build_, then on the _Execution_ tab in the middle.
1. As nefariously as possible (this is important)- hover over the Owasp security step until you see the blue X and click to delete.
