## About this workshop

- This is a live fire exercise. (rafting example)
- I am a nerd and there are references to it. Apologies if you aren't. Everything still works fine.
- Congratulations! You're working at Globalcorp
- We'll each have multiple roles today: Cloud Infrastructure/Platform Team/Fastlane Dev/Choose-your-own-adventure dev
- One incognito window with multiple tabs might work best.

## A) Orientation

### What was already setup?

- Globalcorp account with an organization for our event.
- The organization has a few pre-defined secrets for integrations.
- There are projects in the organization for each login. (RBAC! already! woohoo!)
- Each project is a copy in the multi-verse.

## Key Integration: Ticketing System (Servicenow)
