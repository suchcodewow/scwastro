Accelerators are "recipes" for [modular labs](/docs/k8s) designed to quickly produce a particular configuration.

## Azure Recipe

This azure accelerator builds:

- An Azure Virtual Machine
- k3s kubernetes
- The Dynatrace dtOrders sample application
- Ingresses using nip.io into each service

## Why use this accelerator?

You'll see how kubernetes is built from the ground up, deploy a microservices application, and monitor it easily with Dynatrace.
