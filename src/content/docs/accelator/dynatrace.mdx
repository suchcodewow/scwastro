The steps below summarize installation of the Dynatrace Operator. The only change from default is to set limits on cpu/memory to keep resource consumption low in cloud platforms.

For the latest documentation, [click here](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/setup-and-configuration/setup-on-container-platforms/kubernetes/set-up-k8s-monitoring).

## Create tokens and download files

- In your Dynatrace tenant, click _Deploy Dynatrace_ from the left navigation and then _start installation_.

- Select _Kubernetes_.

- Enter a descriptive name in **Name**.

- Click _create token_ on the **Operator Token** line.

- Turn _Skip SSL certificate check_ **on**.

- Click **Download dynakube.yaml**.

## Modify dynakube.yaml

Open **dynakube.yaml** in a text editor.

:::tip But I love Notepad!
There's nothing wrong with notepad for these tutorials. But if it is front and center in your mind when hear 'text editor', check out VScode when you have time.  
It's a free, open-source, and built to work with all kinds of files (not just code as the name implies).

If you want to try it out now, [click here to download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).  
We'll hang tight right here while you get it ready. Super excited to have you join in.

Find the section starting with **Optional: resource settings for OneAgent container**. Change the requests/limits to match and remove the # signs so it looks like:

```bash
      # Optional: resource settings for OneAgent container. Consumption of the OneAgent heavily depends
      # on the workload to monitor; please adjust values accordingly.
      #
      oneAgentResources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 512Mi
        limits:
          cpu: 300m
          memory: 1.5Gi

```

:::warning YAML gets grumpy easily
YAML config files are extremely sensitive to spacing/tabs/margins. As of this writing, you'll need to remove the # sign and ONE (1) space so that **oneAgentResources:** lines up with the comments above. If you accidentally delete too much, **always** use spaces when adding more.....uh..... space. #ElegantWording

Follow a similar process for the section starting with **Optional: resource settings for ActiveGate container**. Change the requests/limits to match. Remove the # signs so it looks like:

```bash
    # Optional: resource settings for ActiveGate container. Consumption of the ActiveGate heavily depends
    # on the workload to monitor; please adjust values accordingly.
    #
    # Suggested starting point for resources below:
    #
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 150m
        memory: 250Mi
      limits:
        cpu: 300m
        memory: 512Mi

```

- (Optional) Save the file.

- Copy the entire contents of this file (usually with _ctrl+a_ then _ctrl+c_).

In your linux terminal, create and edit dynakube.yaml with:

```bash
nano dynakube.yaml
```

- Paste the contents of the file into this nano window. Then, press _ctrl+x_ and _y_ to save and quit.

## Deploy the Dynatrace manifests

- Back in the Dynatrace tenant, click the **copy** button next to the commands and paste into your linux terminal.

:::tip
Make sure to press < enter > once to send all commands. Because there are multiple lines, the shell will start executing the first command immediately but leave the last one hanging.

## :checkered_flag: Checkpoint

Confirm the Dynatrace operator successfully started with:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n dynatrace
```

Hang tight until you have 4 **ready** pods. The webook and operator spin up quickly. The oneAgent and active gate need a few minutes.

```bash
NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
dynatrace-webhook-5679588856-vwxsn   1/1     Running   0          4m48s
dynatrace-operator-b54bf4694-mwfnf   1/1     Running   0          4m48s
scw-4-19-22-activegate-0             1/1     Running   0          3m43s
scw-4-19-22-oneagent-mk9lt           1/1     Running   0          3m42s
```

:::tip Troubleshooting
If one of the pods fails to start try reviewing the logs as a first troubleshooting step with:

```bash
kubectl logs [podname] -n dynatrace
```

:::

Once 4 pods are ready, return to your Dyantrace tenant.

- Select **Deployment Status** in the left dark menu bar.  
  You should see a new host running in your environment on the **OneAgents** page.
- Select **ActiveGates** in the grey menu bar.  
  You should see a new active gate.

If you see both running, congratulations :tada: ! You've successfully connected Dynatrace to your Kubernetes cluster.
