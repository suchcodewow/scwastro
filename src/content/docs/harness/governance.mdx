## Goals

With Harness, governance and security is paramount- and the platform is uniquely built to provide peace of mind for security teams while empowering software delivery.

In this section, we'll get a view of how a security team could implement critical security policies.. and then show how developers can elegantly, easily meet those policies.

## Lab Guide

:::tip[There can be only one!]
The steps below are just to show how it can be done- you won't have access directly since it's done outside the typical lab permissions. We just need 1 person to be the security team here. Sorry. I'm not sure how to pick. Maybe the first person to call out "Highlander" gets to be the security team? Is that even still a thing? I feel old.

   Click **Policy sets** in the top right  
   View the policy with the mini hamburger button and \*_edit_  
   Finally, flip the switch of "enforced" to on

   ### Development team - What does it mean?
