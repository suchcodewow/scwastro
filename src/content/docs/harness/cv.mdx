Lab 6 - Continuous Verification

### Summary: Automate the verification of new releasesÂ 

**Learning Objective(s):**

- Add continuous verification to the deployed service

- Automate release validation

**Steps**

1. In the existing pipeline, within the Deploy backend stage **after** Canary Deployment step click on the plus icon to add a new step

2. Add a **Verify** step with the following configuration

| Input                        | Value  | Notes                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name                         | Verify |                                                                                                  |
| Continuous Verification Type | Canary |                                                                                                  |
| Sensitivity                  | Low    | This is to define how sensitive the ML algorithms are going to be on deviation from the baseline |
| Duration                     | 5mins  |                                                                                                  |

Click **Save** and then click **Run** to execute the pipeline with the following inputs. As a bonus, save your inputs as an Input Set before executing (see below)

| Input       | Value | Notes       |
| ----------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Branch Name | main  | Leave as is |

Lab 7 - Validate Release

**Learning Objective(s):**

- Identify the difference in traffic between normal and canary instances of the application

- Automate release validation

- Use complex deployment strategies to reduce the blast radius

**Steps**:

- While the canary deployment is ongoing navigate to the web page and see if you can spot the canary (use the check release button)

| project               | domain        | suffix |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ------ |
| http\://\<project_id> | .cie-bootcamp | .co.uk |

- Drill down to the distribution test tab and run the traffic generation by clicking the **Play** button

- Observe the traffic distribution

- Validate the outcome of the verification on the pipeline execution details

**Bonus**:

- Add a canary rollout from 10% to 50% traffic and see how this impacts the traffic distribution
