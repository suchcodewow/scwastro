# Lab 3 - Continuous Deploy - Frontend

### Summary: Extend your existing pipeline to take the artifact built in the CI/Build stage and deploy it to an environment

**Learning Objective(s):**

- Add a second stage to an existing pipeline

- Create a k8s service

- Incorporate an advanced deployment strategy such as Canary

- Create custom Harness variables

- Create an Input Set

**Steps**

2. In the existing pipeline, add a Deployment stage by clicking **Add Stage** and select **Deploy** as the Stage Type

3. Enter the following values and click on **Set Up Stage**

| Input           | Value      | Notes |
| --------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Stage Name      | frontend   |       |
| Deployment Type | Kubernetes |       |

4. Configure the **frontend** Stage with the following\
   **Service**

- Click **+Add Service** and configure as follows\*\*\*\*

**Environment**

The target infrastructure has been pre-created for us. The application will be deployed to a k8s cluster on the given namespace

- Click **- Select -** on the environment input box \*\*\*\*

- Select **prod** environment\*\*\*\*

| Input | Value | Notes                                                             |
| ----- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name  | prod  | Make sure to select the environment and infrastructure definition |

- Click **- Select -** on the environment input box \*\*\*\*

- From the dropdown select k8s

| Input | Value | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Name  | k8s   |       |
