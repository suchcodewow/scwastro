# Azure API Check

## Purpose

The script below tests the connection to the Azure API from your Dynatrace Active Gate (Windows or Linux). It isolates problems with both network (firewall) and credential issues.

## Usage

Download the script and run on your Active Gate. Powershell is required for Windows.

Possible outcomes:

- Failed to Authenticate: There is something wrong with the credentials and the error should provide more detail.
- Credentials Authenticated, but FAILED to retrieve subscriptions: The account successfully authenticated, but doesn't have permissions to any subscriptions
- Successfully Connected and retrieved subscriptions: Credentials worked and retrieved at least 1 subscription. These account details should work in Dynatrace!
