# Azure & Dynatrace: Intro

## A) Introduction

This quick guide essentially condenses a dynabank workshop event down to the deployment steps used.  
It's useful for testing new content or to quickly setup/confirm a working environment ahead of an event.

## B) Before Starting

All Dynabank workshop events use the Dynatrace Cloud Learning (DLF) Facilities. Essentially these are "blank" cloud environments in all 3 major providers (Azure, AWS, and GCP).  
To start, you would either need an attendee account in the DLF for your cloud choice, or you'd need an account in another cloud environment that has access to all components you want to install.

This guide assumes you created (or had someone create) a DLF account for you to use.

## C) Starting the assistant

Log into a cloud shell using the account provided.  
Then, run this command to get started:

```
curl https://www.suchcodewow.io/manifests/pepper.ps1 > ~/pepper.ps1 && pwsh ~/pepper.ps1 -c
```

## D) Cloud specific steps

### Quick overview

Follow the steps shown in Pepper for your cloud provider. Typically this will be 1-2 pre-requisites and then kubernetes. Jump to [Common Steps](http://localhost:3000/docs/pepper/individual#e-common-steps) when you reach the **Dynakube** step.

### What are these steps doing in my provider?

Pepper will determine which cloud environments you can access. When running in the DLF, there will be only one option and Pepper will choose that as default. If you have more than you, the first option to `switch cloud provider` allows you to pick something different.

#### Azure

Azure setup will deploy a resource group first. When you create it, you'll have option to select which region to use. Generally, useast2, uswest2-3 are good choices. (Sometimes useast1 has trouble with enough space to deploy!) All other content you choose to deploy with Pepper will be located in that resource group/zone.  
Next, you'll have the option to deploy Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS). This will build a 1 node 4cpu cluster sufficient to run Dynabank.  
You also have the option to deploy an Azure Web app. If you deploy this, Pepper will create an Azure web services plan with the B1 (basic) settings and create an azure web app on top.

Resources created:

| Component        | Name            |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Resource group   | scw-group-[ID]  |
| AKS cluster      | scw-AKS-[ID]    |
| App Service Plan | scw-ASP-[ID]    |
| Web App          | scw-webapp-[ID] |

#### AWS

AWS requires significantly more steps than the other two clouds due to significant pre-requisites. If you used a DLF admin account and Pepper to create your account, you will likely have the pre-requisites already done. If not detected, Pepper will install those first.  
The AWS commands will use whichever region is currently configured! If you are in the cloud shell, this will typically be the region selected at the top of the UI.  
If you are using Pepper in a local terminal, use `aws configure` to change your settings/region.  
Once the pre-requisites are installed, Pepper will be ready to deploy Elastic Kubernetes Services (EKS). This will create a 1 node 4cpu cluster (Cluster itself & a nodegroup) sufficient to run Dynabank.

Resources created:

| Type      | Component            | Name                         |
| --------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| pre-req   | AWS Role             | scw-awsrole-[REGION]         |
| pre-req   | AWS nodegroup Role   | scw-AWSnodeRoleName-[REGION] |
| pre-req   | Cloudformation stack | scw-AWScfstack-[REGION]      |
| component | EKS Cluster          | scw-AWS-[ID]                 |
| component | EKS Nodegroup        | scw-AWSNG--[ID]              |

#### GCP

Google Cloud will deploy into your current project. This can be selected with the initial startup options in Pepper, or you can configure it in the command window before starting.
Google is fairly straightforward and will simply deploy Google Kubernetes Enginer (GKE). You'll have a 1cpu 4node cluster sufficient to run Dynabank.

Resources created:

| Component | Name          |
| --------- | ------------- |
| Cluster   | scw-gke--[ID] |

## E) Dynatrace Configuration

We'll switch to Dynatrace to create a token needed to connect kubernetes to your tenant.

While we're here, we'll also configure Dynatrace to ensure you are ingesting all metrics, logs, and traces available.

In Dynatrace:

### Create a token

1. open Access tokens settings:
   ![menu](/src/assets/img/deploy1.jpg)
1. Then create a new token with the `API write` permission.
1. Save the token value (i.e. Notepad, Onenote) then click _Done_.
1. Copy the URL of your Dynatrace tenant from the top of your browser and save the URL value with the token value.

### Logs

1. Go to Settings -> Log Monitoring -> Log Ingest Rules.
1. Toggle on [Built-in] Ingest all logs then click _Save changes_ bottom left of screen.

### Bizevents

1. Go to Settings -> Preferences -> OneAgent features.
1. In the Filter by box, type `business event` and press ENTER: ![bizevent1](/src/assets/img/bizevent1.png)
1. Toggle ON _Business Event [Opt-in]_ for .NET, Go, Java, Node.js, and Webserver. Select the drop-down arrow for each and toggle ON _Instrucmentation enabled_.
1. Click _Save Changes_ bottom left of screen.
1. Go to Settings -> Business Analytics -> OneAgent.
1. Click _App new capture rule_ and name it 'AllEvents'.
1. Click _Add trigger_ and set the following values:

| Key         | Value          |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| Data Source | Request - Path |
| Operator    | exists         |

![bizevents2](/src/assets/img/bizevents2.png)

1. In the _Event meta data_ section, set the following values:

| Key                         | Value          |
| --------------------------- | -------------- |
| Event provider: Data Source | Fixed Value    |
| Event provider: Fixed Value | AzureHoT       |
| Event type: Data source     | Request - Path |
| Event type: Event category  | Fixed Value    |
| Event type: Fixed Value     | Request - Path |

1. In the _Event data_ section, click _Add data field_, and then set the following values:

| Key         | Value                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Field name  | params                            |
| Data source | Request - Query String parameters |
| Path        | \*                                |

1. Click _Add data field_ again and then set the following values:

| Key         | Value          |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| Field name  | requestbody    |
| Data source | Request - Body |
| Path        | \*             |

1. Click _Add data field_ again and then set the following values:

| Key         | Value           |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| Field name  | responsebody    |
| Data source | Response - Body |
| Path        | \*              |

1. Click _Save changes_ in the bottom left.

## F) Common steps

### Create dynakube.yaml

:::tip About the dynakube.yaml
It's recommended to let Pepper generate the dynakube.yaml as it is tuned for this event:

- The resource limits are balanced for the kubernetes cluster size used
- Cloud metric support is built-in
- It saves a step in downloading the dynakube.yaml to your computer & uploading the file through cloud shell.

:::

1. In Pepper, select the option to `create: dynakube.yaml`. Provide the URL of your tenant (ex: abc12345.live.dynatrace.com). Don't worry about the https:// or if you have extra characters. Pepper will automatically trim what you enter.

1. Then, paste in the token you created.

:::tip Pasting into cloud shell is hard
Each cloud vendor picked different methods to copy and paste. FUN!

Azure: right-click in the shell window and select 'paste'.

AWS: ctrl+v works just fine (right click and select `paste` works too.)

GCP: ctrl+v only
:::

Pepper will confirm that your URL and token combination is valid and then create a custom dynakube.yaml.

### Deploy Dynatrace

:::tip Dynatrace deployment options
This guide shows how to use Pepper to deploy Dynatrace.

However, it's perfectly viable to drop out of Pepper at this point & use the 'Deploy Dynatrace' app and select Kubernetes install. You'd just need to download dynakube.yaml and upload it to your cloud shell.

Keep in mind that you won't have the tweaks mentioned above.
:::

1. Select the option to deploy dynatrace.

### Hang tight!

Pepper will query the Dynatrace namespace and report how many pods are ready. There is an option to `refresh` the dynatrace namespace.

Hang tight for 1-2 minutes using the refresh option until you have 5/5 pods ready. This is an important step! If you move forward before 5/5 pods ready, Dynatrace won't catch your deployment and won't monitor Dynabank.

1. Refresh the pods a few times over a couple of minutes until you have 5/5 pods.

### Deploy Dynabank

1. Once you have 5/5 pods ready in Dynatrace, select the option to `Download demo apps yaml files`.
   This will pull the yaml blueprints for Dynabank (dbic) and any other demo apps packaged for deployment.

1. Select the option to `Deploy: dbic`. Use the `refresh pods` option over a few minutes until you have all pods deployed.

At this point, Pepper should provide the URL to your environment. Where available, you'll also get a more 'friendly' link.

## G) Cloud-specific deployments

### Azure Web App

#### Deploy

:::tip Prequisite!
Make sure to deploy the Azure web app framework with Pepper prior to completing these steps.
:::

1. In the Azure Console, go to "App Services."
1. Find and click on your webapp. It will be in the _format scw-webapp-[yourid]_.
1. Select the Deployment Center (blue highlight) then External Git as the source (green highlight).  
   ![awa1](/src/assets/img/awa1.png)
1. Copy the following service repository link into the repository field and type `main` for the branch (blue highlight) then Save (green highlight).

```bash
https://github.com/suchcodewow/instamationsvc
```

![awa2](/src/assets/img/awa2.png)

1. Go back to the overview page (blue highlight) and click the default domain (green highlight) to see your new service.
   ![awa3](/src/assets/img/awa3.png)
1. The deployment will likely take a minute or two. You might see a boilerplate message the first time you click- or it might not respond. When successfully deployed, you should see a simple json response simlar to:

```bash
{"status":"ready","appname":"scw-webapp-colossalcactus"}
```

When this appears, it means your service is working! You are ready to move to the next step.

1. Copy the URL of your azure web service from the address bar at the top of your browser to use later.

#### Dynatrace Extension

1. In the inset-menu, click on _Extensions_ within the _Development Tools_ section.
1. Click Add in the main window. Search/Find Dynatrace Oneagent and select it:
   ![extension1](/src/assets/img/extension1.png)
1. At the bottom of the panel, check the agreement box, then click _Add_.
1. Hang tight for a few seconds until it loads, then click the small browse box:
   ![extension2](/src/assets/img/extension2.png)
1. Create a token in Dynatrace with the PaaS template to use here.
1. Using the image below as a guide, paste in the URL of your tenant adding `/api` to the end. Fill in the environment ID using the first part of the URL, then paste in the Paas token created above.
   ![extension3](/src/assets/img/extension3.png)
1. Click _Install OneAgent_ and hang tight until you see _Enjoy monitoring from Dynatrace._ at the top of the screen.
1. In the _Overview_ page of your web app, click the _Restart_ button.

:::tip Lab vs Real World
For most Dynatrace deployments, only the Environment ID is needed. Since we're using Dynatrace tenants that contain the word 'sprint' instead of the normal 'live', we need to specify the Server URL.
:::

#### Dynabank & Azure Web App

1. In Dynabank, Log-in using any random name provided with the orange button top right.
1. Click the orange button top right and click _Operations_.
   ![dynabankwebapp1](/src/assets/img/dynabankwebapp1.png)
1. In the _Estimation Service URL box_, paste in the URL of the Instamation service, then click _save_.
1. Confirm it worked by checking for a _successfully configured_ message. The App Name should reflect your user id. (The value is retrieved directly from your web service to make sure it worked.)
   ![dynabankwebapp2](/src/assets/img/dynabankwebapp2.png)
1. New Collecticare quotes will now automatically by quoted by the Instamation Service! You can check on it by going to Administration:
   ![dynabankwebapp3](/src/assets/img/dynabankwebapp3.png)
1. And reviewing new Collecticare quotes on the first administration panel. Instead of quotes showing up in the _new_ state, they will show as 'quoted' instead:
   ![dynabankwebapp4](/src/assets/img/dynabankwebapp4.png)

#### Dynabank & APIM

Instamation also works through Azure APIM (API Management).

1. In Azure, search for 'APIM' and click on _API Management services_.
1. Click on the APIM for your region in the format _scw-[region]-apim_.
1. Click on _API's_ from the inset-left menu:
   ![apim1](/src/assets/img/apim1.png)
1. And then click on _App Service_.
   ![apim2](/src/assets/img/apim2.png)
1. In the configuration box in the _App Service_ section, Browse for and select your Instamation web application.
1. Copy the name provided into the API URL suffix box. Your Base URL should look something like:

```bash
https://scw-useast2-apim.azure-api.net/scw-webapp-colossalcactus
```

1. Click _Create_.
1. Find your API in the list, click on it (blue highlight), and then click _Settings_ at the top of the details box to the right (green highlight):
   ![apim3](/src/assets/img/apim3.png)
1. Uncheck the _Subscription required_ option box (blue highlight). Click Save (green highlight). This will allow all connections to reach your Instamation service.
   ![apim4](/src/assets/img/apim4.png)

:::tip Lab vs Real World
In a real-world scenario we wouldn't go without a subscription/authorization mechanism. We're doing it here to keep the focus on Observability vs application configuration. Dynatrace will detect all traffic just fine with security in place.
:::

4. Before leaving this screen, find the _Base URL_ of your service and copy it.
1. Confirm it worked by pasting this URL into a new tab of your browser. You should see your service respond just fine behind the apim!
1. In your Dynabank Operations portal (click orange button top right -> Operations), you can replace the Instamation Web App with the APIM version and click _save_. You should receive the same _succesfully configured_ message.
