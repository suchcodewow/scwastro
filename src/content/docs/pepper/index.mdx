This page contains specific notes on differences in cloud providers, Dynatrace itself, and other apps.

## Assistant guide

In summary, Pepper will:

- Query all authenticated cloud environments
- Check the chosen environment for necessary kubernetes components specific to that provider
- Suggest next steps and deploy them when selected
- Assist with the deployment of [Dynatrace Observability Platform](http://www.dynatrace.com)
- Deploy, remove, and display status of sample applications

## About the assistant

The assistant is written in powershell. The main reasons for this are:

- It is well supported natively on all 3 cloud platforms & kept up to date.
- Versus bash, the other built in option, it offers real arraylist support and native json parsing.

It is purposefully written as a single script to allow a quick download vs cloning a repo. However, the file is fully commented and if using vscode, there are instructions at the top for folding the various functions into neat one-liners making the file simple to navigate.

You can run this assistant either in the cloud shell or a local terminal with the cli tools available for your cloud vendor. Please check out the cloud vendor specific notes below if relevant.

### Startup

When started, Pepper will check for access to AWS, Azure, or GCLOUD (possibly multiple when running in a local terminal). It will add viable environments to the providers list.

If there is one default, Pepper will automatically select it and move to the appropriate provider components (see below).

If not, Pepper will present you with a list of cloud options. When you select one, Pepper will remember it.

If you want to switch providers at any time, select the `Switch Cloud Provider` menu option.

### Azure

Pepper checks for the following required Azure Kubernetes components.

- Availability of the az command
- Azure resource group **scw-group-[ id ]**
- AKS kubernetes cluster **scw-AKS-[ id ]** 1 node x Standard_D4s_v5 (4cpu x 16GB)
- AKS credentials to enable kubectl commands (done automatically)

Where **[ id ]** is the alpha part of your email address before the '@' symbol.

When all components are present, Pepper moves to the _common steps_ below.

### AWS

Pepper checks for the following required AWS components.

- Availability of the aws command
- AWS role Arn **scw-awsrole-[ id ]**
- AWs nodegroup Arn **scw-awsngrole-[ id ]**
- AWS cloudformation stack **scw-AWSstack-[ id ]** (contains VPC, subnets, security group)
- EKS kubernetes cluster **scw-AWS-[ id ]**
- EKS kubernetes nodegroup **scw-AWSBG-[ id ]** 1 node x t3.xlarge (4cpu x 16GB)
- EKS credentials (done automatically)

Where **[ id ]** is either the last six characters of your access token ID or the alpha characters up to the '@' of your root account email address.

When all components are present, Pepper moves to the _common steps_ below.

:::info
If your AWS account is not found (typically on a terminal with cli tools installed):

- Check configuration with `aws configure list`. Ensure you have a secret, key, and valid region available.
- Check that pepper can find your account with `aws sys get-caller-identity`. Ideally the ARN should have an email in it. Pepper will extract the alpha characters. If not, it will fall back to whatever is after user/.

:::

### GCP

Pepper checks for the following required GCLOUD components.

- Availability of the gcloud command
- A valid GCP project for the authenticated account
- GKE kubernetes cluster **scw-GKE-[ id ]** 1 node x e2-standard-4 (4cpu x 16GB)

where **[ id ]** is the alpha characters of your account email up to the '@' symbol.

When all components are present, Pepper moves to the _common steps_ below.
:::info
You might need to run `gcloud components update` if you run into script issues.  
You might need to authorize google cloud services via popup.

### Common steps

Pepper checks the existing namespaces and offers deploy/status/remove options as appropriate.

For the dynatrace namespace, Pepper has built-in options to create Paas token, generate dynakube.yaml, and deploy. See _Dynatrace_ below.

As of this writing, Pepper is pre-loaded with DynabankInsuraCart (dbic). The `Download sample apps Yaml` will retrieve the latest deployment file. Any sample app with a yaml file could be added to Pepper.

Once you download the sample app(s), Pepper will offer to deploy, check status, and remove the application.

### Dynatrace

These steps are completely optional. Pepper can do each step for you, give you a jumpstart with a dynakube.yaml, or you can do all steps in the Dynatrace UI.

When you select `dynatrace: Create dynakube.yaml`, Pepper will ask for:

- A Dynatrace tenant ID (i.e. abc12345). It should easily extract it from complete URLS like `https://abc1235.live.>>`, `abc12345.live.>>`, etc.
- A Dynatrace token that has the **Write API Tokens** permission.

Pepper will confirm access and then:

- Create a Paas token & convert it to base64
- Write a local dynakube.yaml file using your tenant URL and token

Then, you can choose the `dynatrace: Deploy to k8s` to have Pepper complete the dynatrace deployment.

Alternatively, you can copy and paste the kubernetes commands from the Dynatrace UI (skipping the download dynakube.yaml part).

### Other Applications

When you choose the `<app>: Deploy App` option, Pepper will apply the downloaded yaml file & install the application.

During deployment, you'll see a report in Pepper of the current status similar to:

```bash
     <app> : Refresh/Show Pods            x/y pods READY
     <app> : Reset Pods
     <app> : Remove Pods
```

If you choose `Refresh/Show Pods`, Pepper will show the result of the pods & update the summary screen with pods currently running.

The `Reset Pods` option will delete all pods in that namespace. This is useful to deployed the app prior to Dynatrace or simply want to lobotimize the application back to starting state.

The `Reset Pods` option shows the URL to your application as well. In most cloud shells, you can ctrl+click to launch the app directly from here. Or copy/paste the URL to a new window.

The `Remove Pods` option simply deletes the application namespace leaving all other applications and the kubernetes cluster running.

### Next Steps?

- Try it out to see Kubernetes deployments or when you want a "real" environment fast to try features
- It's vetting out to be extremely useful for workshops- more opportunity here?
- Add other application yaml (EasyTrade, etc)
- Expand the technology stack (what's most important out there? Logic Apps? fargate? rabbitMQ?)
- Add more problem scenarios, what's used a lot? (CPU saturation? Opentelemetry in network devices?)
