# Hands On: Azure Monitor

## Deployment: Service Principal

1. On Tab #1 in the terminal, exit Pepper if it is running.
1. Run the command below to generate a Service Principal/App Registration:

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name $DEPLOYMENT_NAME --role reader --scopes /subscriptions/9939cbf8-8de6-49a1-a641-b664b214838f --query "{ClientID:appId,TenantID:tenant,SecretKey:password}"
```

1. In Tab #4 Dynatrace, Open the Settings App --> Cloud and Virtualization --> Azure.
1. Click on Connect New instance.
1. Choose a name for the connection.
1. Add the ClientID, SecretKey and TenantID that exported from the Terminal Command line /Azure CLI.
1. Click Connect. That's it!
1. Open the Azure App in Dynatrace to see all resources.

Since we're running many copies of Dynabank in a 'multiverse' kind of scenario, you'll obviously see them all in our Azure Classroom.  
But it does show how easily Dynatrace provides full visibility into an Azure environment with all services instantly tracked, organized, and tagged for easy business organization.
