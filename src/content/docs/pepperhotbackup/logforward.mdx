# Hands On: Azure Log Forwarder

With metrics and traces automatically ingested and baselined, our company wants to include logs as well. The Collecticare development teams use logs to write out critical business information like policy estimates and quoting decisions.

## Deployment

1. In Tab #1, run the Pepper command to retrieve Dynatrace token information.
1. Drag-select all EXPORT commands shown. Right-click and copy. Press _ENTER_ to quit Pepper.
1. At the BASH command prompt, paste the EXPORT commands and press _ENTER_.
1. Copy the Log Forwarder function below & paste it into the terminal window.

```bash
wget -q https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-azure-log-forwarder/releases/latest/download/dynatrace-azure-logs.sh -O dynatrace-azure-logs.sh && chmod +x ./dynatrace-azure-logs.sh \
&& ./dynatrace-azure-logs.sh --deployment-name $DEPLOYMENT_NAME --target-url $TARGET_URL --target-api-token $TARGET_API_TOKEN --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --event-hub-connection-string $EVENT_HUB_CONNECTION_STRING --require-valid-certificate true
```

1. It will take a few minutes to deploy all resources.

#### Fix (DO NOT USE unless instructed)

We discovered during testing that sometimes Azure can be just a little bit grumpy about deploying all of the resources for a functino app at once. Redeploying the function app is super easy- but wanted to have these instructions ready if needed.

```bash
wget -q https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-azure-log-forwarder/releases/download/release-0.1.6/dynatrace-azure-log-forwarder.zip -O dynatrace-azure-log-forwarder.zip
```

```bash
az webapp deployment source config-zip -n $DEPLOYMENT_NAME -g scw-group-nerdycoast --src dynatrace-azure-log-forwarder.zip
```
