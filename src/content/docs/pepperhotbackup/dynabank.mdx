# Hands On: Dynabank

## Deploy Dynabank

1. In tab #1 University Terminal, make sure Pepper is running and select the option to `Download demo apps yaml files`.
1. Select the option to `Deploy: dbic`. Use the `refresh pods` option as needed over a few minutes until you have all pods deployed.
1. When 10/10 pods show ready, click the HTTP link to open Dynabank (or select/drag with mouse right-click to copy, and paste into a new tab).

### Tab 5: Dynabank (Customer)

We recommend moving the Dynabank tab over to position #5 if not there already.

## Explore Dynabank

Dynabank provides its customers the best of everything! It's your "One Stop Shop for Non-Stop Shopping!"

You can:

- pay bills from your bank account
- get quotes for car/home insurance
- shop for everything you need

And with the newly announced acquistion of Collecticare (tm):

- get specialty boutique insurance for your incredibly valuable antiques

### Login

Login with any name provided in the top right. Make sure to try the features above!  
Also, go to the "Administration" panel in the top right and confirm Collecticare quotes appear- but are in the "new" state.

## (Quickly) Explore Dynatrace

### A) Smartscape

1. In your Dynatrace tenant, select the "Smartscape" option from the menu. You'll see that Dynatrace has already generated a topology view.

2. Click any components in Dynatrace to show the automatically tracked vertical relationships for that entity.
   ![verticalsmartscape](/src/img/explore2.jpg)

This visibility is unparalled when planning to move applications to another data center or cloud; All dependencies are clearly visible.

### B) Services View

1. Select "Services" on the left menu. Dynatrace shows all detected services and key metrics for each.
1. Select the "SpecialtyAPI" for Collecticare to see a dashboard and further drilldowns for it:

- The top left block shows what calls this service, what this service depends on, and where it's running
- Bottom left shows service KPI's like failure rate & throughput
- Dynatrace always keeps everything connected. The right side shows ways to view the service flow, back up the chain, and individual traces

In the generation 3 UI, you'll see the front-end calls incoming to the API & backend calls going to the database.
![services](/src/img/specialtytopology.png)

In either view, it's clear that transactions only go to the database.

### C) Kubernetes View

1. Select "Kubernetes" from the left menu (under ), then click on the cluster matching your id.

You'll see a cluster overview, namespaces, workloads, and the option to turn on cluster events.
![services](/src/img/explore10.jpg)

2. Try clicking on the "dbic" namespace on the lower right to see infrastructure metrics.

3. From here, check out the services running and click ordersAPI.

4. On this page, you can see Dynatrace automatically building visibility up to the services provided & down into the infrastructure.

### D) Databases View

![services](/src/img/explore4.jpg)

1. Select "Databases" on the left menu, then "dbic". Similar to services, Dynatrace constantly tracks service dependencies, and underlying infrastructure at all times.
2. Database calls from any source are shown here with the ability to reverse back up the chain with the "view backtrace" button.

### E) Application View

![services](/src/img/explore6.jpg)

1. Select "Frontend" on the left menu (under "Applications & Microservices")
2. Select "My Web Application"
3. Select "1 service" in the lower right of top box.
   ![appservice](/src/img/appservice.jpg)
4. Select "view service flow" to show this applications ecosystem front to back.

It's easy to split applications into their own views. It's done by selecting the "..." in the applications view and "editing detection settings"

## Conclusion

After confirming Observability across our existing application, we'll move forward with deploying additional Azure resources.
