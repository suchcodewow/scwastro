# Azure & Dynatrace

## Welcome!

Welcome to the Azure & Dynatrace 2024 Hot session!  
We've got a jam packed session today with lots of (hopefully!) fun and informative content.

[Download the most up-to-date powerpoint deck here](/manifests/azureperform2024.pdf).

## Initial Setup

We'll be playing the roles of Customer, Developer, Operations, & Dynatrace Admin today around the fictional organization of "Dynabank".  
During setup, we're recommending you keep several tabs open in your browser to help keep things organized.

Recommended browser tabs and corresponding credentials:

- Non-fiction: Dynatrace University (your real-life account)
- Non-fiction: Azure Dynatrace HoT Guide
- Dev / Ops: Azure Portal login (sessionX#@suchcodewow.io)
- Dynatrace Admin: Dynatrace login (attendee#@dynatracelabs.com)

As we deploy resources, you'll also have:

- Customer: dynabankinsuracart.com (logins randomly assigned in demo app)
- Developer: Instamation Service Web App API

### Tab 1: Dynatrace University (your real-life account)

Use your "normal" non-fiction email and password for Dynatrace University.  
(You likely already have this running and used it in order to reach this guide.)

#### Azure Terminal

When you start the University terminal, you'll need to run the one-time command to link Azure.

```bash
az login
```

1. Select the code with a mouse drag, and then right-click and choose "copy". DON'T use copy shortcut (ctrl+c).
2. Click to follow the link and ENSURE you login with your fictional Devops account (sessionX#@suchcode.io)!
3. Enter the code and wait for login to complete. You'll see some data fly by in the terminal when done.

#### Pepper

1. Once connected, start Pepper:

```bash
curl https://www.suchcodewow.io/manifests/pepper.ps1 -s > ~/pepper.ps1 && pwsh ~/pepper.ps1 -c
```

2. Pepper will take an inventory of what is loaded. Check that you see the following resources:

| Component        | Name                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Resource group   | scw-group-[classname]                       |
| AKS cluster      | scw-AKS-[classname]                         |
| App Service Plan | scw-ASP-[classname]                         |
| Web App          | scw-webapp-[classname]                      |
| Dynatrace        | tenant shown in University & 5/5 pods ready |

3. Finally, confirm that the next step in Pepper is to download application yaml files.

We'll use Pepper at several points during the session. You can leave it running. If you do exit, you can use 'up-arrow' to recall the command.  
Or you can just copy and paste from above into your terminal again.

### Tab 2: Azure Dynatrace HoT Guide

You're already here. You did it!

### Tab 3: Azure Portal Login (sessionX#@suchcodewow.io)

Confirm login to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with [classname]@suchcodewow.io. Password provided in Dynatrace University.

[OPTIONAL] As a Dynabank DevOps Cloud admin, you have full access to the Azure environment. You can confirm the resources below.

Resources created:

| Component        | Name                   |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Resource group   | scw-group-[classname]  |
| AKS cluster      | scw-AKS-[classname]    |
| App Service Plan | scw-ASP-[classname]    |
| Web App          | scw-webapp-[classname] |

### Tab 4: Dynatrace (Dynatrace Administrator)

1. Login to Dynatrace using tenant URL and credentials provided in Dynatrace University.
1. Open the "Apps" page.
1. Click Kubernetes (not the "new" one).
1. Confirm you see a cluster running similar to "k8s[classname]".

We'll walk through these steps together, but if you're feeling a bit saucy and already ahead of the game, please feel free to check on these yourself.  
(Honestly we're as excited as you are.)
