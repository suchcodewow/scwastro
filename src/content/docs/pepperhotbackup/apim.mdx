# Hands On: API Mgmt

## Deployment

Once the Dynabank business teams confirmed initial success of Instamation, our next goal is to configure it to use Azure API Management.

1. In Tab #3 Azure Portal, search for 'APIM' and click on _API Management services_.
1. Click on the APIM for your region in the format _scw-[region]-apim_.
1. Click on _API's_ from the inset-left menu:
   ![apim1](/src/img/apim1.png)
1. And then click on _App Service_.
   ![apim2](/src/img/apim2.png)
1. Click the `Browese` button.
1. Type in your id (sessionX#). You should see ONE matching App Service. Select the App Service & click select at the bottom.
1. Copy the name provided into the API URL suffix box. Your Base URL should look something like:

```bash
https://scw-useast2-apim.azure-api.net/scw-webapp-colossalcactus
```

1. Click _Create_.
1. Find your API in the list, click on it (blue highlight), and then click _Settings_ at the top of the details box to the right (green highlight):
   ![apim3](/src/img/apim3.png)
1. Uncheck the _Subscription required_ option box (blue highlight). Click Save (green highlight). This will allow all connections to reach your Instamation service.

:::tip Lab vs Real World
In a real-world scenario we wouldn't go without a subscription/authorization mechanism. We're doing it here to keep the focus on Observability vs application configuration. Dynatrace will detect all traffic just fine with any configuration.

1. Before leaving this screen, find the _Base URL_ of your service and copy it.
1. Confirm it worked by pasting this URL into a new tab of your browser. You should see your service respond just fine behind the apim!
1. In your Dynabank Operations portal (click orange button top right -> Operations), you can replace the Instamation Web App with the APIM version and click _save_. You should receive the same _succesfully configured_ message.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've helped Dynabank modernize speclaity quoting leveraging easy deployments in Azure. With Dynatrace, we've extended visibility into our entire application ecosystem throughout Azure.

In Dynatrace, go back to the services page. Dynatrace automatically stitches together calls from the specialtyAPI out to the Azure Web App through the APIM.
